# KuyLiner
**KuyLiner** is the continuation of the current [Food Navigator](https://github.com/reinhart1010/food-navigator) app with significant changes:

1. Uses Laravel instead of static page
2. Further optimized for mobile

Some portions of this app includes prototypes for a [COMP6644 - Software Engineering](http://curriculum.binus.ac.id/course/comp6644) and Enterpreneurship: Prototype Development II project at BINUS University, where some OpenStreetMap features are extended with experimental features:

+ Donations
+ Ratings (pulled from other sources)
+ GoFood, GrabFood, and ShopeeFood integration
